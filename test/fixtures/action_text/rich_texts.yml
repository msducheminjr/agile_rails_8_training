    pieces o' 8 is just US dollars. If you are treating pieces o' 8 as one eighth of
    a dollar, then you would multiply by 8 to get your price.</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

    <em>The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide</em>
    Ruby is one of the most important programming languages in use for web
    development. It powers the Rails framework, which is the backing of some
    of the most important sites on the web. The Pickaxe Book, named for the
    tool on the cover, is the definitive reference on Ruby, a
    highly-regarded, fully object-oriented programming language. This updated
    edition is a comprehensive reference on the language itself, with a
    tutorial on the most important features of Ruby—including pattern
    matching and Ractors—and describes the language through Ruby 3.3.

    <em>Practical Techniques for Performance and Growth</em>
    Rails doesn’t scale. So say the naysayers. They’re wrong. Ruby on Rails
    runs some of the biggest sites in the world, impacting the lives of
    millions of users while efficiently crunching petabytes of data. This
    book reveals how they do it, and how you can apply the same techniques to
    your applications. Optimize everything necessary to make an application
    function at scale: monitoring, product design, Ruby code, software
    architecture, database access, caching, and more. Even if your app may
    never have millions of users, you reduce the costs of hosting and
    maintaining it.
